# Criminal Investigation Tracker and Trace-back using Packet Marking and Logging
The research paper introduces an IP traceback scheme that combines packet marking and logging to trace the origins of cyber-attacks. It aims to improve the identification of attack sources, especially in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, while optimizing storage and resource use.
